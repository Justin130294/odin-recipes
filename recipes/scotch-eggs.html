    <p>Air Fryer Scotch Eggs</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons Greek yogurt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons mango chutney (such as Patak's®)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon mayonnaise</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon pepper</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon curry powder</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon cayenne pepper (Optional)</li>
        <li>1 pound pork sausage (such as Jimmy Dean®)</li>
        <li>6 eggs, hard-boiled and shelled</li>
        <li>⅓ cup flour</li>
        <li>2 eggs, lightly beaten</li>
        <li>1 cup panko bread crumbs</li>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine yogurt, chutney, mayonnaise, salt, pepper, curry powder, and cayenne in a small bowl. Refrigerate until ready to use.</li>
        <li>Divide pork sausage into 6 even portions. Flatten each portion into a thin patty. Place one egg in the middle and wrap the sausage around the eggs, sealing all sides. Set eggs aside on a plate.</li>
        <li>Preheat air fryer to 390 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Place flour into a small bowl and beaten eggs into another small bowl. Place panko bread crumbs onto a plate. Dip each sausage-wrapped egg into flour, then dip into beaten egg, letting the excess drip off. Roll in bread crumbs and place onto a plate.</li>
        <li>Spray basket of the air fryer with cooking spray and place eggs into the basket. Do not overcrowd; cook in batches if necessary. Cook for 12 minutes, turning eggs over halfway through. Repeat with remaining eggs. Serve with dipping sauce.</li>
    </ol>
